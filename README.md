# Churn-Modelling-Problem
ANN to predict if an individual customer will leave the bank or stay.

The goal of the project is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict if an individual customer will leave the bank or stay based on geo-demographical and transactional information. All the customers are also ranked based on their probability of leaving.

The dataset consists of 10,000 customer's name, customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, number of products used, estimated salary.

The ANN was able to predict results with the accuracy of about 85 %.
